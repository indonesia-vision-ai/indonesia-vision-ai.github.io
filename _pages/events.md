## Indonesia Vision AI Events Calendar

Welcome to our events page where you can find details about upcoming events and past sessions. Currently, we host a paper reading group discussion, but we are open to suggestions for future events and collaborations.

### Paper Reading Group

Our paper reading group sessions are designed to explore papers of mutual interest among group members. These sessions occur once every two weeks, providing a platform for insightful discussions.
